                <h3>To be a hero</h3>
                <p>Due to her powers of telepathy, Jean is able to sense and feel everyone's emotions around her,
                    allowing her to be extremely empathetic towards everyone. She displays this when she tells Cyclops
                    she is worried about Rogue, explaining to him she somewhat understands Rogue's fears of touching
                    others, as when she and Cyclops kiss or touch, when he is suffering, Jean feels it as though it is
                    her own suffering. Jean is an aura of love and sympathy and compassion, a generous, gentle soul of a
                    woman who at times can be guilty of loving and caring too much. Jean is vibrant, intelligent,
                    soft-spoken, loyal, courageous, caring and kind, shown to be a friend towards everyone and hates the
                    idea of Wolverine, Cyclops or any of her other teammates getting hurt.</p>
